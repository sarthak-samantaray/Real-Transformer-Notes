    "- We need to divide the d_model with number of head.\n",
    "- self.d_k : See the picture above , the small matrices are dk , this means , if we are using multi head attention then each head will see the whole sentence but different part of the dimension from 512. Basically it is the size of that matrix.\n",
    "- If we want some words to not to interact with other words , we mask them.\n",
    "- As you can see , the formula for attention , we sqrt(dk) there , that means we are calculating it for head.\n",
    "- So if we want some words to not to interact with others , we set them a very small value , so that after softmax , it will be nearly zero , and the model will not focus on those much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- d_model: Dimensionality of the input embeddings. This is the size of the input vectors.\n",
    "- h: Number of attention heads. Each head processes a subset of the input embedding.\n",

    "```After transpose: (2, 3, 4, 4) (Batch=2, Heads=3, Seq_Len=4, d_k=4).```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition Behind Dimensions and Their Role\n",
    "- Batch and h adjacency: Each batch contains multiple sequences. Each sequence is split into h heads, so this adjacency allows us to calculate attention across all heads in one step.\n",
    "- Seq_Len and d_k: After transposition, these remain the dimensions of focus for each head. Each head processes the same sequence length (Seq_Len) but focuses on its respective subspace of features (d_k).\n",
    "#### Flow of Computation\n",
    "- Preparation: The input embeddings are split into h heads using a linear layer, producing (Batch, Seq_Len, h, d_k).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transpose: Rearrange dimensions with .transpose(1, 2) to get (Batch, h, Seq_Len, d_k). Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Each head’s attention operates on its slice (Seq_Len, d_k).\n",
    "  - Computation for all heads is parallelized because Batch and h are adjacent.\n",
    "- Attention Calculation: Compute attention per head:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *𝑄𝐾⊤* becomes ```(Batch, h, Seq_Len, Seq_Len).```\n",
    "- Multiply with V, producing (Batch, h, Seq_Len, d_k).\n",
    "#### Reconstruction: \n",
    "- Concatenate the heads back after attention computations and project the combined output back to the original embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Does Moving h Next to Batch Help?\n",
    "- Placing h next to Batch ensures all heads are processed simultaneously by modern hardware (e.g., GPUs/TPUs).\n",
    "- The resulting shape (Batch, h, Seq_Len, d_k) simplifies tensor operations because heads are now treated as additional batches for computation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why self.w_o?\n",
    "Now, the self.w_o layer is needed because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Projection into the desired output space:** Even though the output tensor x has the correct shape (Batch, Seq_Len, d_model), it doesn't necessarily have the correct content yet.\n",
    "  - The purpose of self.w_o is to project the concatenated and attended outputs of all heads back into the desired feature space.\n",
    "  - This is important because, during the attention process, each head computes its own set of attention scores, and the resulting tensor might not represent the desired feature mapping.\n",
    "  - self.w_o ensures that the output is appropriately transformed back into the space of d_model features that the model expects after the attention step.\n",
    "- **Learnable transformation:** self.w_o introduces learnable parameters that allow the model to learn how to combine the results from different heads and project them into the appropriate feature space.\n",
    "  - The learned weights in self.w_o allow the model to mix and combine information from all attention heads more effectively."

    "### Overview of BilingualDataset Class:\n",

    "    self.src_lang = src_lang\n",
    "    self.tgt_lang = tgt_lang\n",
    "\n",
    "    self.sos_token = torch.Tensor([tokenizer_src.token_to_id(['SOS'])], dtype=torch.int64)  # SOS token for source\n",

    "```\n",
    "#### Purpose of __init__: \n",
    "- The constructor initializes the dataset and tokenizer for both the source and target languages, and sets up the special tokens (SOS, EOS, PAD) for the source language using the source tokenizer.\n",
    "- sos_token, eos_token, and pad_token are tensors holding the indices of the corresponding tokens in the tokenizer's vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",

    "    return len(self.ds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of __len__: \n",
    "- Returns the number of data samples in the dataset, which is simply the length of self.ds. This is needed for PyTorch to know the total number of items in the dataset when iterating.\n",

    "```\n",

    "- The sentences (src_text and tgt_text) are tokenized into numerical indices using the source and target tokenizers (tokenizer_src and tokenizer_tgt).\n",
    "- Padding tokens are calculated to ensure the source and target sequences are of the desired length seq_len. We subtract 2 for source padding (SOS and EOS), and 1 for target padding (SOS only, since we stop predicting once EOS is generated).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Padding and Token Concatenation:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if enc_num_padding_tokens < 0 or doc_num_padding_tokens < 0:\n",
    "    raise ValueError('Sentence is too long')\n",

    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of cocatenation:\n",
    "- encoder_input: The source sequence is concatenated with the SOS token at the start, the EOS token at the end, and padding tokens (if necessary).\n",
    "- decoder_input: The target sequence is concatenated with the SOS token at the start and padding tokens at the end.\n",
    "- label: The target sequence (without SOS) is followed by the EOS token and then padded. This represents the true target output for the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assertion to Check Lengths:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert encoder_input.size(0) == self.seq_len\n",
    "assert decoder_input.size(0) == self.seq_len\n",
    "assert label.size(0) == self.seq_len\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose of assertion: Ensures that the length of encoder_input, decoder_input, and label matches the desired seq_len.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Masks and Returning the Data:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return {\n",
    "    \"encoder_input\": encoder_input,  # (seq_len)\n",
    "    \"decoder_input\": decoder_input,  # (seq_len)\n",

    "    mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(1, size, size), diagonal=1).type(torch.int)\n",
    "    return mask == 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Purpose of casual mask:\n",
    "- This function creates a causal mask used in the decoder to prevent attending to future tokens during training (as per the \"autoregressive\" nature of the decoder). It ensures that each position in the decoder can only attend to itself and previous positions, but not to future tokens.\n",
    "- The torch.triu() function creates an upper triangular matrix, and mask == 0 ensures that only the lower triangular part is True (valid positions), while the rest are False (invalid positions)."
